This is going to be my first attempt at making a website based on what I've learned through the Odin Project.
Some of the skills I plan/hope to display in this website include:
	* Make a list (Organized & unorganized)
	* Create multiple pages within the website
	* Create functioning hyperlinks
	* Display images
	* Display text with headings of different strengths, and body paragraphs with bold and italicized words.
	* Creating and giving my website a title
	* Create strong commit messages
	* Publish accurate and correct code
